# Khan-Academy-Project

The is my project based interview for Khan Academy.
The premise is implement an API that checks students'
code for certain paramters. *e.g. Does this code have a for loop?
Does this code have a variable declaration*

Once that is done, you have to build a codepen to play with the API

#Instructions

1.) git clone

2.) open index.html

3.) Select a checkbox to test a parameter, the result will appear aa few seconds after checkbox selection.

4.) To disable automatic testing, hit the *manual* button. And instead test using the *push* button.
