## Khan-Academy-Project

The is my project based interview for Khan Academy.
The premise is implement an API that checks students'
code for certain paramters. *e.g. Does this code have a for loop?
Does this code have a variable declaration*

Once that is done, you have to build a codepen to play with the API

#Instructions

1.) git clone

2.) open index.html
